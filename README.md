# WDNFFunctions
The code in this repository implements the algorithms and experiments in the following paper:
> G. Ozcan, A. Moharrer, S. Ioannidis, "Submodular Maximization via Taylor Series Approximation", SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM), Virginia, US, 2021.

We implement the continuous-greedy algorithm with samplinng and polynomial estimators.
