The code in this repository implements the algorithms and experiments in the following paper:
> G. Ozcan, A. Moharrer, S. Ioannidis, "Submodular Maximization via Taylor Series Approximation", SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM), Virginia, US, 2021.

In summary, 
- We introduce a class of submodular functions that can be expressed as weighted compositions of analytic and multilinear functions.
- We propose a novel polynomial series estimator for approximating the multilinear relaxation of this class of problems.
- We show that multiple applications, e.g., document summarization, influence maximization, facility location, and cache networks can be cast as instances to our framework.
- We conduct experiments for multiple problem instances on both synthetic and real datasets.
